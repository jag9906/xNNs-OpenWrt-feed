This is a prerelease version of mpm-itk for Apache 2.4.7 or newer.
2.4.6 or before will not work; for 2.2.x, there's an entirely different
patch set (see http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/).

It is much less tested than the 2.2.x series, so exercise caution;
however, several organizations do run it in production. Follow the
mpm-itk mailing list (http://lists.err.no/mailman/listinfo/mpm-itk)
for more information as it becomes available.

To build, simply run configure and then make; you may have to adjust the apxs
path, e.g.

  ./configure --with-apxs=apxs2

or

  ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

Similarly, make install (as root) will install the module, after which you can add

  LoadModule mpm_itk_module modules/mpm_itk.so

to your httpd.conf.
